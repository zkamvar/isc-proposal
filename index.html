## NOTES

These are notes from talking with Yanina about [my twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ZKamvar/status/1573363038669111298?s=20&t=fhQlFMOf1AuH2baVbjvsCQ)

lessons that are not in R can use this infrastructure <- this is a good pitch

The fact that The Carpentries has high impact for larger communities.

Proposals like this have a good chance.

Try to highlight a tool for people who want to create training materials with The Carpentries philosophy

lesson will have evidence-based teaching practices.

we are providing tools to make it easier. No expertise on GitHub Actions, Quarto, YAML needed.

Highlight that The Carpentries materials are used in other places.

<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [ ] What the problem is
 - [ ] Who it affects
 - [ ] Have there been previous attempts to resolve the problem
 - [ ] Why it should be tackled
-->
<p>Of all languages, R is the most versatile when it comes to literate programming and the ability to rapidly publish results thanks to the advent of R Markdown. More importantly, unlike JSON-based formats like Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown enables <strong>reproducible collaboration</strong> under version control. Literate programming also enables the creation of maintainable and reproducible teaching materials. To host such materials, however, requires not only expertise in a domain area, it also requires knowledge of continuous deployment systems, reproducible workflows, and UI elements for the Web. Designed with our Core Values in mind, The Carpentries<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> lesson infrastructure provides templating, guidance, and tools to allow rapid development and publication of high-quality lesson content. The lesson contributor only needs to focus on writing the content of the lesson in Markdown or R Markdown. With this infrastructure, we champion community collaboration and access for all.</p>
<p>The infrastructure—called The Carpentries Workbench<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>—is a “batteries-included” setup for building lessons that allows anyone to take new or pre-existing Markdown or R Markdown lesson materials and create a lesson site. The Carpentries Workbench uses {knitr} to render R Markdown documents to Markdown, followed by pandoc and {pkgdown} to render Markdown to HTML. For lessons that teach R, authoring R Markdown with a seamless integration with {renv} ensures that lessons are reproducible by default. Moreover, integration with GitHub Actions means that pull request previews can show lesson maintainers exactly where output in a lesson has changed from new contributions or package updates.</p>
<p>Lessons that do not teach R, however, must use plain Markdown where the output of demonstrative and exercise code is copy and pasted into lessons. Copy and pasting outputs is inherently non-reproducible and makes non-R lessons difficult to maintain as the software ecosystem changes and evolves. Ultimately, these extra steps are significant burdens in a volunteer framework. They result not only in lost contributions to existing lessons, but also in lessons that were never developed.</p>
<p>For context, The Carpentries teaches 36 core lessons through its three Lesson Programs, Software, Library and Data Carpentry. Six of these lessons teach core R skills, which are widely used within and outside The Carpentries with 60,000 unique views for the “R for Ecologists” lesson alone from June to August 2022. In addition, there are over 100 community-developed lessons on a wide range of topics in The Carpentries Incubator, 15 of which use R. This means that there are over one hundred lessons that potentially stand to benefit from literate programming.</p>
<p>There have been attempts in The Carpentries community to enable literate programming for lessons teaching with languages other than R. Some lesson authors who work with Python have created a separate folder of Jupyter notebooks and render them to Markdown, which is then used as the input for the lesson (see <em>Intro to MRI Data in Python</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> for example). This allows the lead developers to work in a framework that offers the benefits of literate programming, but it hampers collaboration because the documentation for lesson infrastructure does not apply to this framework and people who want to contribute may attempt to edit the Markdown output, when they should be contributing to the notebooks.</p>
<p>Others, such as the <em>Learn To Discover</em> group<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> have used {reticulate} in The Carpentries Workbench to provide interoperability between R and Python. This gives the advantage that contributors are able to contribute to the lesson, but the format is not familiar or clear, and the approach does not generally extend to enable literate programming in other languages.</p>
<p>In both cases, the lesson authors needed knowledge of continuous deployment, reproducible workflows, and of the underlying framework to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>We value people first, access for all, community collaboration, and strength through diversity, and we want our lesson infrastructure to reflect these values. We propose to eliminate the extra burdens required to contribute to non-R lessons and create opportunities to create cross-language lessons by integrating Quarto<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> into The Carpentries Workbench. Released in July 2022, Quarto is a framework based on the same principles as R Markdown that allows anyone to write their analysis in their preferred programming language and easily publish their results in a reproducible manner.</p>
<p>We have lowered the barrier for others to access our evidence-based approach to lesson design and deployment. Because The Carpentries materials are always open-source, many organisations have used and remixed our infrastructure for their own purposes. By incorporating Quarto, we will be able to increase the quality of non-R lessons and help strengthen the bridge between languages to enable lessons in other languages and eventually polyglot lessons. This will in turn help train future generations of researchers to work reproducibly.</p>
<h2 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h2>
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined.
-->
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->
<p>We will enable support for reproducible publishing of non-R languages in The Carpentries lesson infrastructure by integrating the Quarto publishing engine into The Carpentries Workbench. The Carpentries Workbench is an opinionated lesson publication system as a set of R packages that prioritises accessibility and sensible defaults to produce Carpentries-styled lessons. With a modular foundation, The Carpentries Workbench uses a two-step workflow that first renders R Markdown to Markdown via {knitr} followed by a step that uses Pandoc to render Markdown to HTML templating. Because this is a similar model to that used by Quarto, we propose to replace the underlying engines of {knitr} + Pandoc with Quarto in our modular foundation without affecting the superstructure.</p>
<p>Our goal is to eliminate barriers to contribution of lesson materials by increasing the number of langugages available. Moreover, Quarto will enable development of lessons demonstrating Python to R, Julia to R, or any other multi-lingual workflow. These multi-lingual lessons can demonstrate R’s strengths in the context of another language and help promote R to people who would not have previously encountered the language.</p>
<p>By reducing barriers to contribution, more people will be empowered to create educational materials <em>based on The Carpentries philosophy</em>. These new educational materials will help to usher in a new generation of data scientists and researchers from more diverse backgrounds who will have the confidence and ability to use reproducible research practices to solve problems.</p>

<li><strong>Weeks 2-3:</strong> Replace {knitr} with {quarto} inside of <code>sandpaper:::render_html()</code> to achieve polyglot capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Weeks 4-6:</strong> Harness pyenv to create non-invasive versioning system for Python documents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Phase 2: Development of Quarto templates <strong>(8 weeks)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weeks 7-10:</strong> Alpha testing of local workflows with users with various levels of expertise and development of remote workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Weeks 11-12:</strong> Create lua filters to replace XPath manipulation currently in {sandpaper}.</li>
<li><strong>Week 13:</strong> Create pandoc templates. <!-- Extremely Milton Dammers as portrayed by Jeffrey Combs in the 1996 thriller "The Frighteners" voice: The number 13... Unlucky for some --></li>
<li><strong>Week 14:</strong> Update {varnish} and <code>sandpaper:::build_html()</code> to use Quarto pandoc templates.</li>

<h3 id="definition-of-done">Definition of done</h3>
<!--
What does success look like?
-->
<p>This project will have succeeeded when our core Python lessons can include dynamically generated plots and output. Reaching this stage means that we have successfully implemented Quarto into the Workbench and documented the new functionality. All Python lessons in the core curriculum of our Lesson Programs will use Quarto, and the Maintainers of these lessons will be able to comfortably work with the infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-success">Measuring success</h3>

<p>Markers of success in this project will include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the ability to port our existing official lessons that use Python to use dynamic generation of plots and output in their lessons.</li>
<li>creation of four levels of documentation: tutorial, how-to, discussion, and reference.</li>
<li>at least one maintainer from each Python lesson being able to build their lesson locally.</li>
<li>at least one lesson in The Carpentries Incubator using literate programming for a non-R lesson.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="future-work">Future work</h3>
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?

<li>Significant changes to the pricing model or ethical standing of GitHub Actions, which The Carpentries uses heavily to dynamically deploy lessons. This is mitigated by ensuring that core deployment mechanisms in the R packages are agnostic to higher-level frameworks so that we can pivot to a different deploy system if needed.</li>
<li>Lack of uptake by communities outside The Carpentries. We will mitigate this by publicising our work from the start of the project, and soliciting feedback from early adopters.</li>
<li>Staffing shortages due to unanticipated circumstances (COVID, natural disaster, etc). <!-- ZNK: yes, I know this is Too Dark Park, but I _think_ it should be addressed --> The project team will provide training on the Workbench to Carpentries core team and community members, to increase the number of people able to contribute to the project.</li>
<li>Running arbitrary code in literate programming documents is a security risk and could pose a situation where bad actors inject malicious code into our lesson websites. This is mitigated by secruity protocols from The Workbench that leverage the principle of least privilege and regular rotation of access tokens on GitHub.</li>
